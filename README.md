# mern-auth-system
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete token-based authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It supports secure user registration, login, and protected route access using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Passwords are safely handled through bcrypt hashing, ensuring no sensitive data is ever stored in plain text.
